Bindings:

Instead of storing string literals for bindings within the env, we could look at all the
types in the proc_def and push a bind opcode for each parameter. This means we don't need
to store more data at compile-time and it's only during run-time, within a proc call.

eg.

test():
# Bind opcodes are automatically inserted in the parser
bind c, b, a
# a = 1, b = 2, c = 3

main():
1 2 3 !test
