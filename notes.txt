Proc Defs:
HashMap<String, vector<ProcDef>>

Each function will be mapped in the hashmap with its definition. This will help support overloading.
We check if arity matches and then proceed to check types of parameters. If we match, an existing proc
exists and we cause an error. If not, go to next node to check. If we get to the end, we add a new node.

ProcCall will require the index of func name and the sub index, which refers to how far across the node list 
it is. We could possibly use a vector, so we can index immediately instead of a linked list. If a vector is not
allowed, we will have to use the linked list.

ProcNode:
ProcDef struct
ProcNode* next
